## Practice problems

### Practice Problem 10.2

The disk file `foobar.txt` contains the six ASCII characters `foobar`.

Output: `c = f`

`open()` converts a filename to a file descriptor and returns the
file descriptor number or -1 on error. (The wrapper function
`Open()` catches the error.) `read()` copies *n* bytes from the
current file position of a file descriptor and stores it in a
buffer passed as an argument, returning the number of bytes copied,
or 0 if EOF, or -1 on error. (The wrapper function `Read()` catches
the error.)

Here, the integer variables `fd1` and `fd2` are assigned two
different file descriptors for the same file. This means that when
we read 1 byte from `foobar.txt` and assign the result to the
buffer `c`, the character read from `foobar.txt` is the first
character, "f", each time. In other words, the statement `Read(fd1,
&c, 1)` copies the byte representing the first character, "f", to
the buffer `c`, and the statement `Read(fd2, &c, 1)` copies the
same byte again. Each file descriptor maintains its own position in
the file.

The authors of CSAPP3e suggest that one might easily misread this
code and suppose that the statement `Read(fd2, &c, 1)` reads
the *second* character, "o", from `foobar.txt`, instead of the
first character, "f". But that isn't the case. I did not find this
example as confusing as they expected.

```c
void pp10_2() {
    int fd1, fd2;
    char c;

    fd1 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    fd2 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    Read(fd1, &c, 1);
    Read(fd2, &c, 1);
    printf("c = %c\n", c);
}
```

### Practice Problem 10.3

The disk file `foobar.txt` contains the six ASCII characters `foobar`.

Output: `c = o`

`fork()` returns 0 to the newly created child process. Here, if we
are in the child process, we read one byte of `foobar.txt` and store
it in the buffer `c`. At this point, the buffer `c` stores a byte
representing the character "f".

Next, we wait for the (for any) child process to complete, then we
read another byte from `foobar.txt`. Since the child process
inherited the file descriptor from the parent process, and has now
completed, and we are reading from the same file descriptor, this
second `read()` operation now stores a byte representing the second
character in "foobar", which is "o".

```c
void pp10_3() {
    int fd;
    char c;

    fd = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    if (Fork() == 0) {
        Read(fd, &c, 1);
        exit(0);
    }
    Wait(NULL);
    Read(fd, &c, 1);
    printf("c = %c\n", c);
}
```

### Practice Problem 10.5

The disk file `foobar.txt` contains the six ASCII characters `foobar`.

Output: `c = o`

`dup2()` duplicates the specified file descriptor. Here, we read
the first byte of `foobar.txt` into `c` using file descriptor
`fd2`. `fd2` is now at byte position 1 in `foobar.txt`. Next, we
call `dup2()` on `fd2`, assigning it to `fd1`. Now, `fd1` is also
at byte position 1 in `foobar.txt`. When we read one more byte
from `foobar.txt` using `fd1`, the buffer `c` stores the second
character, in "foobar", which is "o".

```c
void pp10_5() {
    int fd1, fd2;
    char c;

    fd1 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    fd2 = Open("foobar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    Read(fd2, &c, 1);
    Dup2(fd2, fd1);
    Read(fd1, &c, 1);
    printf("c = %c\n", c);
}
```

### Homework Problem 10.6

Output: `fd2 = 4`.

`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are assigned file descriptors
0, 1, and 2. So, if we create two more file descriptors, those are
3 and 4. If we then close one, we're back to 3. If we open one more,
we're back up to 4.

```c
void hwp10_6() {
    int fd1, fd2;
    fd1 = Open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    fd2 = Open("bar.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    Close(fd2);
    fd2 = Open("baz.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    printf("fd2 = %d\n", fd2);
}
```

## main()

After calling `pp10_5()` and before calling `hwp10_6()`, we need to
close all file descriptors opened in the previous function calls,
so we can get an accurate value when calling `hwp10_6()`. `stdin`,
`stdout`, and `stderr` are assigned file descriptors 0, 1, and 2.
We created two more file descriptors (3 and 4) in `pp10_2()`, one
more (5) in `pp10_3()`, and two more (6 and 7) in `pp10_5()`. So,
before calling `hwp10_6()`, we need to close file descriptors 3
through 7, inclusive.

```c
int main() {
    printf("Calling pp10_2...\n");
    pp10_2();
    printf("\n");

    printf("Calling pp10_3...\n");
    pp10_3();
    printf("\n");

    printf("Calling pp10_5...\n");
    pp10_5();
    printf("\n");

    int fd;
    for (fd = 3; fd <= 7; fd++) Close(fd);

    printf("Calling hwp10_6...\n");
    hwp10_6();
}
```

Sample output:

```
$ gcc scratch.c && ./a.out
Calling pp10_2...
c = f

Calling pp10_3...
c = o

Calling pp10_5...
c = o

Calling hwp10_6...
fd2 = 4
$
```
