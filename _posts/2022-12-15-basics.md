## Question 1

> What are the types of the following expressions and what do they
> evaluate to, and why?

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert (17 = 17);                            (* 17 → int *)
    assert (11 = 1 + 2 * 3 + 4);                 (* 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 → int *)
    assert (1 = 800 / 80 / 8);                   (* 800 / 80 / 8 → int
                                                   `/` performs int division *)
    assert (400 > 200);                          (* 400 > 200 → bool *)
    assert (not (1 <> 1));                       (* 1 <> 1 → bool *)
    assert (true || false);                      (* true || false → bool *)
    assert (not (true && false));                (* true && false → bool *)
    assert (not (if true then false else true)); (* bool *)
    assert ('%' = '%');                          (* '%' → char *)
    assert ('a' <> 'b');                         (* 'a' and 'b' → char *)
    ;;
```

## Question 2

> Consider the evaluations of the expressions `1 + 2 mod 3`, `(1 + 2)
> mod 3`, and `1 + (2 mod 3)`. What can you conclude about the `+` and
> `mod` operators?

Conclusion: `mod` has higher precedence than `+`.

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert (1 + 2 mod 3 = 1 + (2 mod 3));
    assert ((1 + 2) mod 3 = 0);
    assert (1 + (2 mod 3) = 3);
    ;;
```

## Question 3

> A programmer writes `1+2 * 3+4`. What does this evaluate to? What advice
> would you give him?

Advice: if what you want is the product of 1+2 multiplied by 3+4,
parenthesize the addition expressions to prevent the multiplication from
being performed first due to the higher precedence of the multiplication
operator `*`.

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 = 1 + (2 * 3) + 4);
    assert (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 = 1 + 6 + 4);
    assert (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 = 11);
    ;;
```

## Question 4

> The range of numbers available is limited. There are two special
> numbers: `min_int` and `max_int`. What are their values on your computer?
> What happens when you evaluate the expressions `max_int + 1` and `min_int
> - 1`?

4611686018427387904 is 2^62 so this reflects implementation for a 64-bit
system. `min-int` -1 is equivalent to `max_int` and `max_int` + 1 is 
equivelant to `min_int`.

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert (min_int = -4611686018427387904);
    assert (min_int -1 = max_int);
    assert (max_int =  4611686018427387903);
    assert (max_int + 1 = min_int);
    ;;
```

## Question 5

> What happens when you try to evaluate the expression `1 / 0`? Why?

As expected, `Exception: Division_by_zero` is raised.

## Question 6

> Can you discover what the `mod` operator does when one or both of the
> operands are negative? What about if the first operand is zero? What
> if the second is zero?

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert (-4 mod  3 = -1);
    assert (-4 mod -3 = -1);
    assert ( 0 mod  2 =  0);
    ;;
```

`2 mod 0` raises `Exception: Division_by_zero`.

## Question 7

> Why not just use, for example, the integer `0` to represent false and
> the integer `1` for true? Why have a separate `bool` type at all?

If type safety is a priority, then it makes sense to have a Boolean type
instead of using some other type to represent a Boolean value.

## Question 8

> What is the effect of the comparison operators like < and > on
> alphabetic values of type `char`? For example, what does `’p’ < ’q’`
> evaluate to? What is the effect of the comparison operators on the
> booleans, `true` and `false`?

As in other languages, here presumably alphabetic values of type `char`
are represented as character code point values and it is those code
point values that are being compared:

```ocaml
let _ =
    assert ('a' < 'z');
    assert ('z' > 'a');
    assert ('p' < 'q');
    ;;
```

As for Boolean values, presumably this reflects the common
representation of `true` using `1` and `false` using `0`?

```ocaml
let _ = 
    assert (true  <> false);
    assert (true   > false);
    assert (false  < true);
    ;;
```
