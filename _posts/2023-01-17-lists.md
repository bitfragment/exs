## Question 1

> Write a function `evens` which does the opposite to `odds`, returning
> the even numbered elements in a list. For example, `evens [2; 4; 2; 4;
> 2]` should return `[4; 4]`. What is the type of your function?

The function's type is `α list` because it can operate over a list of
items of any data type (it only inspects the list items, it does not
perform operations on them).

```ocaml
let rec length l =
    match l with [] -> 0
    | _::t -> 1 + length t

let rec even_elts l =
    if length l < 2 then [] else
    match l with [] -> []
        | _::b::t -> b :: even_elts t
        | _ -> l

let _ =
    assert (    [] = even_elts []);
    assert (    [] = even_elts [0]);
    assert (   [1] = even_elts [0; 1]);
    assert (   [1] = even_elts [0; 1; 2]);
    assert ([1; 3] = even_elts [0; 1; 2; 3]);
    assert ([4; 4] = even_elts [2; 4; 2; 4; 2]);
    ;;
```

Hint provided: "Consider three cases: (1) the argument list is
empty, (2) the argument list has one element, (3) the argument list has
more than one element `a::b::t`. In the last case, which element do we
need to miss out?"

## Question 2

> Write a function `count_true` which counts the number of `true`
> elements in a list. For example, `count_true [true; false; true]`
> should return `2`. What is the type of your function? Can you write a
> tail recursive version?

Type is `bool list -> int` because we are testing for Boolean values
and returning an integer value representing the quantity of Boolean values
in the list.

```ocaml
let rec count_true l n =
    match l with [] -> n
        | h::t -> match h with
            true -> count_true t (n + 1)
        | _ -> count_true t n

let _ = 
    assert (0 = count_true [] 0);
    assert (0 = count_true [false] 0);
    assert (0 = count_true [false; false] 0);
    assert (1 = count_true [false; true] 0);
    assert (2 = count_true [true; false; true] 0);
    ;;
```

## Question 3

> Write a function which, given a list, builds a palindrome from it. A
> palindrome is a list which equals its own reverse. You can assume the
> existence of `rev` and `@`. Write another function which determines if
> a list is a palindrome.

Using `List.rev` since that can be assumed:

```ocaml
let palindrome l =
    if l = [] then l else l @ (List.rev l)

let is_palindrome l =
    l = (List.rev l)

let _ =
    assert ([] = palindrome []);
    assert ([1; 1] = palindrome [1]);
    assert ([1; 2; 2 ;1] = palindrome [1; 2]);
    assert (is_palindrome []);
    assert (is_palindrome [1]);
    assert (is_palindrome [1; 2; 1]);
    assert (is_palindrome [1; 2; 2; 1]);
    assert (not (is_palindrome [1; 2]));
    assert (not (is_palindrome [1; 2; 3]));
    ;;
```

## Question 4

> Write a function `drop_last` which returns all but the last element of
> a list. If the list is empty, it should return the empty list. So, for
> example, `drop_last [1; 2; 4; 8]` should return `[1; 2; 4]`. What
> about a tail recursive version?

My solution assumes that for a list containing a single element, that
element should be dropped.

```ocaml
let rec drop_last l =
    match l with [] -> []
    | [a] -> []
    | h::t -> h :: drop_last t

let _ =
    assert ([] = drop_last []);
    assert ([] = drop_last [1]);
    assert ([1; 2] = drop_last [1; 2; 3]);
    assert ([1; 2; 4] = drop_last [1; 2; 4; 8]);
    ;;
```

Tail recursive version takes the length of the list as an argument.

```ocaml
let rec drop_last_tr n l =
    if n = 0 then l else
    match l with
    | [] -> []
    | [a] -> []
    | h::t -> h :: drop_last_tr (n - 1) t

let _ =
    assert ([] = drop_last_tr 0 []);
    assert ([] = drop_last_tr 1 [1]);
    assert ([1; 2] = drop_last_tr 3 [1; 2; 3]);
    assert ([1; 2; 4] = drop_last_tr 4 [1; 2; 4; 8]);
    ;;
```

(To avoid having to pass the length of the list, one could call the
function `length` defined in my solution for Question 1 above.)

## Question 5

> Write a function `member` of type ***α* → *α* list → bool** which
> returns `true` if an element exists in a list, or `false` if not. For
> example, `member 2 [1; 2; 3]` should evaluate to true, but `member 3
> [1; 2]` should evaluate to false.

This was tricky for me, for some reason. To match the argument `e` with
the head `h` of the list `l`, I first tried the expression `match h with
e -> true`. Print debugging (I tried `ocamldebug` and found it
impossible to use at this point, with my limited knowledge) confirmed
that this did *not* match the *values* of those integer variables —
perhaps it was matching only their *types*?

The expression that works is `match (h, e) with (a, b) when a = b -> true`.

Which the book's explanation of pattern matching had not prepared me
to understand. Either there is an easier way to implement this answer to
this question, within the scope of this chapter's coverage, or the
question is not solvable within that scope.

This code includes an example of print debugging using `Printf.printf`
and `#trace`. (I tried diving into `ocamldebug` but ahem.)

```ocaml
let rec member e l =
    match l with [] -> false
    | h::t ->
        (* let () = Printf.printf "h=%i, e=%i\n" h e in *)
        match (h, e) with (a, b) when a = b -> true
        | _ -> member e t
    ;;

(* #trace member;; *)

let _ =
    assert (not (member 1 []));
    assert (member 1 [1]);
    assert (not (member 1 [2]));
    assert (member 2 [1; 2]);
    assert (not (member 2 [1; 3]));
    assert (member 2 [1; 2; 3]);
    assert (not (member 3 [1; 2]));
    assert (member 'a' ['a'; 'b']);
    assert (member 'b' ['a'; 'b']);
    assert (not (member 'c' ['a'; 'b']));
    ;;
```

# Question 6

> Use your `member` function to write a function `make_set` which, given
> a list, returns a list which contains all the elements of the original
> list, but has no duplicate elements. For example, `make_set [1; 2; 3;
> 3; 1]` might return `[2; 3; 1]`. What is the type of your function?

The function's type is `α list` because it can operate over a list of
items of any data type (it only inspects the list items, it does not
perform operations on them).

```ocaml
let rec make_set l =
    match l with [] -> []
    | [a] -> [a]
    | h::t ->
        if member h t then make_set t else h :: make_set t
    ;;

let _ =
    assert ([] = make_set []);
    assert ([1] = make_set [1]);
    assert ([1; 2] = make_set [1; 2]);
    assert ([1; 2; 3] = make_set [1; 2; 3]);
    assert ([1] = make_set [1; 1]);
    assert ([1; 2] = make_set [1; 1; 2; 2]);
    assert ([1; 2] = make_set [1; 2; 2]);
    assert ([1; 2] = make_set [1; 2; 2; 2]);
    assert ([2; 3; 1] = make_set [1; 2; 3; 3; 1]);
    assert (['a'; 'c'; 'b'] = make_set ['a'; 'b'; 'a'; 'c'; 'c'; 'b'; 'b'])
    ;;
```

# Question 7

> Can you explain why the `rev` function we defined is inefficient? How
> does the time it takes to run relate to the size of its argument? Can
> you write a more efficient version using an accumulating argument?
> What is its efficiency in terms of time taken and space used?

The `rev` function defined in the chapter is inefficient because in
processing the list, the head of the list is appended to the tail using
the `@` operator, which takes time proportional to the length of its
first argument. For this reason, the time the `rev` function takes to
run is proportional to the *square* of the length of the list.

My tail-recursive solution, using an accumulating argument, takes time
proportional to the length of the list alone.

```ocaml
let rec rev_l l acc =
    match l with [] -> acc
    | h::t -> rev_l t (h::acc)
    ;;

let rev l = rev_l l [];;

let _ =
    assert ([] = rev []);
    assert ([0] = rev [0]);
    assert ([1; 0] = rev [0; 1]);
    assert ([2; 1; 0] = rev [0; 1; 2]);
    assert ([5; 4; 3; 2; 1; 0] = rev [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]);
    ;;
```

Hint provided: "Consider in which order the `@` operators are evaluated
in the reverse function. How long does each append take? How many are
there?"

Solution presented in book is identical to mine:

```ocaml
let rec rev_inner a l =
    match l with [] -> a
    | h::t -> rev_inner (h::a) t

let rev_bk l = rev_inner [] l

let _ =
    assert ([5; 4; 3; 2; 1; 0] = rev_bk [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5]);
```
